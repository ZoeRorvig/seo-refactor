## Description
The Horiseon website features information about Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. It also discusses the benefits of these topics, including Lead Generation, Brand Awareness, and Cost Management. 

The Horiseon website has been optimized for search engine and accessability purposes:
- The title has been changed from "website" to "Search Engine Optimization & Social Media Marketing | Horiseon" to provide greater context. 
- Added metatags - including description, keywords, author, and viewport. 
- The "seo" in "Horiseon" now reads "Search Engine Optimization" when hovered over to improve understanding of the acronym "SEO."
- All non-semantic tags (div and span) have been changed to semantic tags (including header, nav, abbreviation or abbr, section, main, article, aside, and footer). 
- All internal linkage in the navigation bar has been reviewed and corrected, if needed. 
- Items in the navigation bar now shows a line under each link when hovered over to show linkage.
- All featured icons and pictures now include alt attributes for screenreader use or incase of broken image links. 
- Cleaned up CSS classes to prevent redundancy in the code.
